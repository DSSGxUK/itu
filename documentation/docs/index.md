This project develops a predictive model to estimate the number of people connected to the internet (internet, in this instance, is a proxy for access to social and economic opportunities). The model was trained on a combination of survey data and multiple open source datasets. With the help of the custom engineered data gathering pipeline, the open source data can be collected for any given country and either the existing model can be applied or a new model can be trained if survey data is available.

This project was built from June - August 2021 and is a collaboration between the [Data Science for Social Good Fellowship at the University of Warwick, UK](https://warwick.ac.uk/research/data-science/warwick-data/dssgx/) and the [International Telecommunications Union](https://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx), a UN Agency.
